# 4- Data Race

Project Stack: Power Pages, Power Virtual Agent, Dataverse, Power Automate

# 5- SMC Kanban Board

Project Name: SMC Kanban Board 

Project Link:  

Project Stack: Power Pages, Dataverse, Html, CSS, Js, Liquid

Project Description: The goal of this project was to create a task management app similar to a GitHub board for Sterling Medical Corporation.

Here's what we did:

- Used Power Pages to create a custom web template that matches the client's branding.
- Used Liquid code to create a navigation menu on the left side and made it look good with custom styling.
- Built the entire app using a custom approach with Power Pages.

Note: The project was later changed to a canvas app based on feedback from the client and our team because it was only for their internal users.
